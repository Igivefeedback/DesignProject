                       My name is Felix Hufmann. I was tasked to make a website of my choice for a project in my Design class at St. Thomas High School. As the creator of the hockey player ranking website, I am dedicated to providing accurate and comprehensive information about all the talented players in the game. My passion for hockey began at a young age, and I have followed and played hockey ever since. With a keen eye for talent and a deep understanding of the game, I have developed a unique perspective on what makes a great player. Through rigorous research, analysis, and a commitment to fairness, I aim to create rankings that are respected and valued by hockey enthusiasts around the world. By continuously updating and fine-tuning my rankings, I strive to provide an unbiased and transparent platform for players to be recognized and appreciated for their contributions to the sport. As a hockey player myself, I understand the hard work and dedication it takes to reach the top, and I am driven to showcase the incredible skills and achievements of players in the hockey community.
